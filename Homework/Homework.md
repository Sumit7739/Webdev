### Code of Conduct for Homework Submissions

1. **Respect File Structure**
   Ensure that your homework files follow the existing folder structure. Do not modify or move files that belong to others.

2. **Use Proper File Naming**
   Follow the naming conventions set for homework files. For instance, use `Homework1.md`, `Homework2.md`, etc., without any extra characters or spaces.

3. **Commit Messages**
   Write clear, concise, and meaningful commit messages when uploading your homework. Example:
   `Added Homework 1 for [Your Name]`

4. **Avoid Conflicts**
   Always pull the latest changes from the repository before pushing your homework. This will help you avoid merge conflicts with others' work.

5. **Timely Submission**
   Submit your homework on time. Late submissions may not be merged into the main branch.

6. **No Deletions**
   You are only allowed to add files. Do not delete or modify homework submitted by other students unless it's your own.

7. **Quality Check**
   Double-check your work for accuracy and formatting before submitting. Make sure your homework renders correctly in Markdown.

8. **Respect Privacy**
   Do not share or upload sensitive or personal information about yourself or others.

By adhering to these rules, we can ensure a smooth and collaborative workflow for everyone!
