**Components of Linux:**

1. **Kernel**: The core part of the operating system that manages hardware resources and facilitates communication between hardware and software.
    
2. **Shell**: The command-line interface that allows users to interact with the system by executing commands.
    
3. **File System**: The structure that organizes and stores files on disk. Common file systems in Linux include ext4, XFS, and Btrfs.
    
4. **Utilities and Tools**: A set of programs and applications that perform various tasks, such as file manipulation, system monitoring, and network management.
    
5. **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: While Linux can be used entirely from the command line, many distributions offer graphical environments like GNOME, KDE, and XFCE for easier user interaction.
