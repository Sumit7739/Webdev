## Project: Building a Google Photos Alternative

As part of this course, we will be working on an exciting projectâ€”building a **locally hosted Google Photos alternative**. This project will take you through the complete web development process, from designing user interfaces to managing media files. You'll learn how to:

- Create a responsive gallery for photos and videos.
