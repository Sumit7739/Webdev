  
**History of Linux**
In 1991, Finnish student Linus Torvalds developed the Linux kernel as a free alternative to Unix. Inspired by Minix and the GNU Project, he released it under the GNU General Public License, allowing global collaboration. Early distributions like Slackware, Debian, and Red Hat made Linux more accessible. Combining the Linux kernel with GNU components resulted in a robust, open-source operating system. Today, Linux is renowned for its stability, security, and versatility, used in servers, desktops, mobile devices, and embedded systems.
